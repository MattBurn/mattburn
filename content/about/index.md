My name is Matthew Burn (Matt for short)...

I am a computational chemist phd student currently studying at the university of manchester. As a computational chemist I often get to work between the lines of Computer Science, Physics and Chemistry.

My current work involves:
- Quantum Mechanics
- Molecular Mechanics
- Machine Learning

I may touch on these subjects sometimes in this blog but I don't intend to bore anyone with lectures about them. Instead, this blog is instended to be an accumulation of interesting projects I happen to come across during my research and bring you along with me.

Languages:
- Python
- Rust
- Processing
- Fortran (Don't judge me)

Interests:
- Machine Learning
    - Gaussian Process Regression
    - Neural Networks
- High Performance Computing
- Physics Simulations
- Computer Graphics

As I learn and develop more, these languages and interests will grow so stay tuned...
